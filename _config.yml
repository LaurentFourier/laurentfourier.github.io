# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,

  Spectral Decomposition is a political analysis blog by Laurent Fourier.
  Each article breaks down complex power structures and ideological distortions
  using clear, evidence-based argumentâ€”much like a Fourier transform isolates
  signal from noise. These essays are crafted as legal-style briefs against
  the normalization of authoritarianism in a post-truth world.
