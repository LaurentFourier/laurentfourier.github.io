title: "Terror Is the Tool: How the Far-Right Rewrites Law and Loyalty to Silence Dissent"

excerpt: >
  When defending due process becomes “terrorism,” democracy is no longer under siege—it has already been overthrown. The Trump-aligned right is exporting a blueprint for authoritarianism across the Atlantic, with think tanks like the Heritage Foundation at the helm. This article traces how far-right actors have hijacked security discourse to silence dissent and criminalize justice itself.

In a political climate where truth is indistinguishable from propaganda and authoritarianism marches forward draped in flags, the word “terrorist” has become less a descriptor of violence and more a tool of domination. The latest signpost on this descent is a declaration by Trump’s former counterterrorism czar: that advocating for due process for Kilmar Abrego Garcia—an alleged gang member—constitutes “aiding and abetting terrorism.” The claim is absurd on its face. But it’s also something worse: it’s a weaponization of state power against anyone who dares resist the right’s agenda. And that agenda is increasingly global.

## Due Process as Subversion

Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s case is emblematic of how the right intends to redefine justice itself. No trial. No evidence. No constitutional protections. Instead, suspicion becomes guilt, and defending someone's right to a fair hearing is cast as terrorism. This is not simply an attack on the legal system—it is an effort to reverse the moral architecture of democracy.

But this is not an isolated incident. It’s the latest chapter in a decades-long strategy to blur the lines between protest and terrorism, dissent and subversion. This ideological campaign has been cultivated over generations by far-right institutions and law-and-order think tanks. The ***Heritage Foundation’s “Project 2025”*** is not the origin of this movement—it is its culmination: a modern, tactical blueprint for authoritarian restructuring of the U.S. government, including plans to purge civil servants, politicize federal law enforcement, and centralize power in the executive. The same network behind Project 2025 is now coordinating with far-right politicians in Europe to replicate this program across the Atlantic[^1].

## From Heritage to Homeland Security

The Heritage Foundation is not a think tank in the traditional sense—it is a political command center for the reactionary elite. Founded on Cold War anti-communism and sustained by billionaire dark money, Heritage has long treated civil liberties as obstacles to be overcome, not principles to be honored. Its policy papers routinely blur the line between policing and warfare, between domestic politics and ideological conquest.

It was Heritage, alongside Trump-aligned groups like the Claremont Institute and the Federalist Society, that helped craft the ideological scaffolding for Trump's post-truth autocracy. And it was Heritage that helped channel Israel's *hasbara*-style media manipulation into U.S. domestic discourse, shaping public perception through fear, nationalism, and scapegoating.

Now, with the European far-right emboldened by Trump’s legacy, the same architects of Project 2025 are reportedly advising fascist-aligned EU politicians. The playbook is identical: use the pretext of “counterterrorism” to ban protests, detain immigrants, rewrite constitutions, and strip civil society of its last protections[^2].

## Fascist Kinship and the Global Reactionary Bloc

This isn’t theoretical. The Trump advisor making the claim against Kilmar Abrego Garcia is known not just for his authoritarian zeal but for personal ties to fascist movements. His family lineage includes open Nazi sympathizers, and his public statements evoke an unrepentant hunger for vengeance masked as patriotism[^3].

This pattern—ideologues with fascist sympathies ascending to positions of legal and security oversight—is not coincidental. It’s structural. What we are seeing is the formation of a **transnational reactionary bloc**, tied together by shared interests: ethno-nationalism, religious authoritarianism, and elite protectionism.

At the heart of this network are organizations like Heritage. Their goal is simple: replace the rule of law with rule by decree. Erase the distinction between enemies of the state and critics of the regime. Make “terrorism” a term so broad that it includes anyone who believes in justice.

## A Call to Name the Real Terror

In such a world, who are the real terrorists? The ones who detain people without charge? Who flood the media with disinformation? Who criminalize lawyers, judges, and journalists? Who whisper in the ears of demagogues and then flee accountability under the cover of think tank legitimacy?

We must name them. **The Heritage Foundation** is not merely ideological—it is operational. It is a node in a global network that seeks to remake democracy in the image of apartheid states and police regimes. It is not just complicit in authoritarian drift. It is driving it.

And it must be understood as such—not as a misguided academic institution, but as a political actor engaged in the orchestration of systemic repression.

## Defending the Line

Advocating for due process is not terrorism. It is the bare minimum of any society that claims to be just. And anyone who tells you otherwise is not defending law—they are preparing to destroy it.

The lines are now clear. Either we uphold the principles of justice for all, or we surrender to the spectacle of permanent emergency, where the only crime is defiance, and the only truth is fear.

We are not simply fighting for Kilmar Abrego Garcia's rights. We are fighting for the right to have rights at all.
