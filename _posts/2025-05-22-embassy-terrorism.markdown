excerpt: >
  When peaceful resistance is crushed and genocide becomes routine, violence no longer signals victory—it signals collapse. This isn't a justification. It's the philosophical reckoning we face when the world watches atrocity in silence.
---

When entire populations are being crushed, dehumanized, and erased with the full complicity—or indifference—of the international system, **despair breeds radical action**.

At that point, violence stops being about strategy. It becomes a signal:  
> *We will not go quietly.*

That doesn’t make it right. It makes it **inevitable**. And that’s the harder truth.

### Between Law and Ethics

It’s possible to say this plainly:

- **Yes**, the embassy shooting was terrorism.
- **Yes**, it was wrong.
- **Yes**, the attacker will be prosecuted. And **should** be.

But also:

- He likely doesn’t feel remorse.
- Not because he’s a monster—but because he sees himself as sacrificing his life for thousands dying unseen.
- That mindset, whether you agree with it or not, isn’t madness.  

He acted out of the belief that there is **no other way left** to make the world feel what Gaza feels every day.

### It Hurts the Cause

Let’s be honest about that too.

- It hurts Palestinians strategically.
- It confirms media narratives that paint the oppressed as extremists.
- It justifies more surveillance, repression, and border militarization.
- It is used to silence legitimate demands for justice.

But in a world where **Gaza is on fire and everyone is watching with folded arms**, it may also feel like the **only remaining way to scream loud enough to be heard**.

### “What Actions Are Left?”

That’s not rhetorical.  
It’s the question of our era—and Palestinians have been forced to ask it since before 1948.

What happens when:

- Protest is met with batons and surveillance,
- Human rights reports are shelved or mocked,
- UN votes are vetoed before the ink dries,
- Legal appeals are looped into endless dead ends,
- The media sanitizes genocide into “complex conflict,”
- And all the while, children are being buried under rubble?

**What’s left?**

At some point, people stop trying to be heard.  
They start trying to be remembered.

### If the Goal Is Justice…

If the goal is **justice**, not revenge...

If we imagine a future where **Palestinian children don’t have to be martyrs to matter**...

Then we have to name violence for what it is—not glorify it, not sanitize it, not demonize it, but **understand it**.

And that means:

- Holding space to grieve Israeli deaths **without** excusing Israeli war crimes.  
- Mourning violent choices **even when they feel inevitable**.  
- Staying absolutely clear-eyed that the **greatest violence**, the one that fuels all others, is **structural**, **systematic**, and **state-backed**.

### Final Thought

You don’t have to justify what happened.  
But you also don’t have to pretend it came out of nowhere.

This isn’t endorsement.  
It’s recognition of the collapse that leads people to trade their future for a moment of vengeance or visibility.

The true obscenity isn’t that someone finally snapped.  
It’s that **so many others haven’t**, and still the world does nothing.

If we want to stop this, we have to stop what made it feel necessary in the first place.

Not later. Now.
