  Billion-dollar think-tanks, foreign agents, and corporate fronts are executing a silent hijacking of
  American democracy. This manifesto unmasks their playbook, follows the dark money, and issues a
  nationwide call for a general strike before the window for resistance slams shut.

THIS IS NOT A DRILL
===================

We are under siege, and the assault was designed to be nearly invisible. Billion-dollar think-tanks, foreign agents, and corporate fronts now write public opinion, cast paid “citizens” to astroturf, and schedule midnight votes they alone know are coming—all so the hijacking looks inevitable instead of orchestrated. Every viral outrage, every avalanche of fake “science,” every lawsuit timed to land before a hand-picked court or public hearing is a choreographed strike on the foundations of democracy. **None of this is organic.** It is financed, rehearsed, and rolling out at a speed meant to overwhelm us into silence. The liberal establishment will not save us; it is too busy cashing checks from the very billionaires driving this coup while pretending to resist, while fascists sprint through the breach with chainsaws. **This is the last clear moment before the lights go out.**

## 1 · The Blueprint Beneath the Chaos

Copy-and-paste laws arrive in statehouses by the dozen because the American Legislative Exchange Council has stockpiled “model bills” for almost every topic imaginable; legislators drop them word-for-word, then rush them to a vote. Christian-nationalist operatives in Project Blitz run the same play on religion, feeding assemblies pre-drafted attacks on reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ existence. When Texas unleashed SB 8—the bounty-hunter abortion ban—it was never a lone experiment; it was a proof of concept. Within months, copycat bills were submitted across a dozen states, all aimed at luring the Supreme Court into tearing Roe apart. **None of this is organic.**

## 2 · Fake Crowds, Real Power

Paid “grass-roots” armies dominate public comment. They arrive with talking points, travel stipends, and the exact schedule of a bill the public can’t see. Genuine residents wait twenty hours for a three-minute slot—if they ever get one. The system is rigged to silence opposition and rubber-stamp the coup. **None of this is organic.**

---

## 3 · Follow the Dark Money

Alliance Defending Freedom—architect of anti-trans and anti-abortion litigation—reported **over \$102 million** in revenue last year alone. Heritage’s *Project 2025* blueprint openly plots mass firings of career civil servants and the transfer of federal power to partisan loyalists. And in the 2024 cycle, a single pro-Israel lobby poured **more than \$50 million** into campaigns, aligning U.S. policy with the agenda of an indicted prime minister and the billionaire associates collaborating on the hostile takeover of American democracy. **None of this is organic.**

## 4 · Why the Tempo Is Accelerating

Demographics, court cases, and public opinion are turning against corporate-establishment and Christian-nationalist goals. The architects know they must lock the system now—gerrymander districts, purge voter rolls, challenge millions of legitimate votes without oversight, pre-load courts with ideologues—before the numbers turn against them for a generation. Each outrageous law, each invented panic about books or bathrooms or “litter boxes,” is designed to make half the population hate or fear the other half enough to see fascism and executive overreach as necessary. Fear is their lubricant for emergency powers. Like Netanyahu’s endless “wartime” status, the plan is to keep America in a permanent state of crisis until democracy is unrecognizable. **None of this is organic.**

## 5 · Your Civic Duty

Allies abroad are already drafting contingency plans. They know that once the United States is fully hijacked by this profit-driven death cult, no treaty, climate accord, or human-rights norm is safe. **Our apathy is now a global liability.**

There is no artificially high rent bill, no slave-wage shift, no streaming distraction more urgent than stopping this coup. Organize where you live, build strike committees, map supply lines, and weave mutual-aid networks that outlast any paycheck. Every kitchen-table meeting, every worker ready to walk out, pries another rivet from the corporate state. **No corporate-approved politician can lead this fight; leadership must rise from real people, accountable to no one but the community itself.** Look one another in the eye, choose the day the wheels stop turning, and make the world feel our absence. Do not wait on someone else—this is up to **YOU**.

## 6 · The Line We Draw

| # | **Non-Negotiable Demand**           | **Why It Matters — Subtext** |
|---|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **1** | **Universal Ballot Access** | Reinstate and expand the Voting Rights Act, outlaw partisan gerrymanders, and make Election Day a paid national holiday. *If you can’t vote freely and conveniently, nothing else on this list can hold.* |
| **2** | **One Person, One Dollar** | Overturn *Citizens United* and end corporate personhood; cap individual donations and ban super-PACs. *Money is property, not speech; democracy collapses when billionaires drown out millions.* |
| **3** | **Real-Time Transparency** | Post every campaign dollar, donor, and lobby contact within 24 hours—no dark money, no exceptions. *Sunlight stops corruption before it metastasizes.* |
| **4** | **Foreign-Influence Firewall** | Ban any campaign, PAC, or nonprofit from accepting funds or strategy tied—directly or indirectly—to a foreign government. *Policy must serve constituents, not overseas power brokers.* |
| **5** | **Ban Copy-Paste Legislation** | Outlaw “model” bills; require a 30-day public review before any floor vote and publish all amendments in plain language. *Legislating should happen in daylight, not through corporate templates rushed at midnight.* |
| **6** | **Lobbying Under Oath** | Force all lobbyists, think tanks, and PR shops to register, disclose clients, and testify under penalty of perjury; ban undisclosed “consulting.” *Underground influence is bribery by another name—make it a felony.* |
| **7** | **Term & Age Limits** | Cap House and Senate service at 18 years combined; set an upper age limit of 75 for all federal elected offices. *A revolving door of new leaders prevents permanent political fiefdoms.* |
| **8** | **Re-Balance the Supreme Court** | Expand the Court to 18 seats, stagger six-year terms, mandate retirement at 70, and create an independent inspector-general with subpoena power. *No lifetime throne, no unchecked ethics violations.* |
| **9** | **Emergency-Powers Safeguard** | Require a two-thirds congressional renewal vote every 30 days for any declared national emergency; bar emergency orders from altering elections. *Authoritarians govern by “temporary” crisis—cut that cord.* |
| **10**| **Critical-Media Infrastructure** | Fund independent journalism, mandate algorithmic transparency for social platforms, and embed media literacy in K-12 curricula. *An informed populace is the last line of defense against manufactured consent.* |

*Any strike ends only when every item above is codified—by statute or constitutional amendment. No half-measures, no sunset clauses. This is the firewall between democracy and collapse.*

History will ask what we did when the lights began to dim. We can answer with bowed heads and whispered regrets—or with a united, thunderous refusal that rattles every marble hallway from state capitols to K Street. **This is not a drill. None of this is organic. Stand together, or surrender everything.**
