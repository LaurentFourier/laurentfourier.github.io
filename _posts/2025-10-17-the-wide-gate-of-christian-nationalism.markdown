# Charlie Kirk vs. Jesus: The Wide Gate of Christian Nationalism

> “Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction.” — *Matthew 7:13*

Charlie Kirk has built a movement around a fusion of Christianity and nationalism—what he calls “biblical citizenship.”  
But when we compare his rhetoric to the words of Jesus, the distance becomes clear.  
The contrast reveals a modern version of the “broad road”: a faith retooled for power, grievance, and exclusion rather than humility, love, and mercy.

## 1. The Stranger vs. “Project 10 Million”

> “We need to do Project 10 Million—removing the ten million alien invaders in this country… it’s going to launch a soft civil war.”  
> — *Charlie Kirk, Turning Point podcast (2025)*

**Jesus said:**  
> “I was a stranger and you welcomed me.” — *Matthew 25:35*  
> “Love your enemies.” — *Matthew 5:44*

The call to “remove” millions of immigrants, described as *invaders*, reverses the gospel’s demand to show compassion toward the outsider.  
Jesus never sanctioned collective punishment or civil conflict; his kingdom advanced by mercy, not deportation.

## 2. Violence as “a Prudent Deal”

> “It’s worth it to have some gun deaths every year so we can have the Second Amendment.”  
> — *The Charlie Kirk Show*

**Jesus said:**  
> “Blessed are the peacemakers.” — *Matthew 5:9*  
> “Put your sword back in its place.” — *Matthew 26:52*

To treat preventable deaths as an acceptable price for liberty is to invert Christ’s ethic of sacrificial love.  
For Jesus, human life is not collateral—it is sacred.

## 3. Condemning the Outcast

> “Being gay is an error… Leviticus 18 says a man lying with another man should be stoned.”  
> — *Podcast remark, 2024*

**Jesus said:**  
> “He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone.” — *John 8:7*  
> “Judge not, that ye be not judged.” — *Matthew 7:1*

Jesus consistently elevated compassion over condemnation.  
Invoking scripture to justify violence or exclusion repeats the very hypocrisy he condemned in the Pharisees.

## 4. Truth Without Mercy

> “Doctors who perform gender-affirming care deserve a Nuremberg-style trial.”  
> — *Turning Point Conference, 2025*

**Jesus said:**  
> “Do not resist an evildoer… love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.” — *Matthew 5:39–44*

Christ’s justice is restorative, not retributive.  
Calling for vengeance courts the same spirit of judgment he warned would destroy the soul.

## 5. Pride, Power, and Dominion

> “This is a Christian nation, and I want to keep it that way. The separation of church and state is a myth.”  
> — *Turning Point USA Summit*

**Jesus said:**  
> “My kingdom is not of this world.” — *John 18:36*  
> “The greatest among you shall be your servant.” — *Matthew 23:11*

Earthly dominion was never his mission.  
When faith becomes a banner for political conquest, it trades the cross for a flag.

## 6. Contempt for the Marginalized

> “Some of these prominent Black women don’t have the brain processing power to be taken seriously… they have to go steal a white person’s slot.”  
> — *Audio surfaced 2025*

**Jesus said:**  
> “Whatever you did to the least of these my brothers, you did to me.” — *Matthew 25:40*  
> “All of you are equal as brothers and sisters.” — *Matthew 23:8*

Racial contempt and mockery of the weak contradict everything about the gospel’s radical equality.  
The carpenter from Nazareth knelt to wash feet; he did not rank intellect by color.

## 7. The Wide Gate

Kirk’s message replaces Jesus’s narrow way of self-denial with a broad path of tribal identity and moral superiority.  
It promises belonging without repentance, dominance without humility, and salvation without obedience.

The historical Jesus warned precisely against this counterfeit faith:  
those who call him “Lord” yet refuse to do the Father’s will (Matthew 7:21).

## Conclusion

Charlie Kirk speaks often of defending Christianity.  
But what he defends is not the gospel—it is cultural power draped in its symbols.  
The original Jesus called followers to surrender power, not seize it.  
His gate remains narrow, his way steep, and his demand unchanged:

> “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.” — *Luke 9:23*
