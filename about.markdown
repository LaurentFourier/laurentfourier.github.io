I’m **Laurent Fourier**—a writer, researcher, and perpetual question‑asker focused on the fault‑lines where politics, technology, and power collide.  
This blog exists to track those intersections, highlight under‑reported stories, and push back against narratives that normalize authoritarianism.

### What you’ll find here

* **Deep‑dive essays** on propaganda networks, surveillance tech, and civil‑liberties battles.  
* **Readable breakdowns** of dense reports, court filings, and policy papers.  
* **Curated links & footnotes** so you can verify every claim (and follow the rabbit holes yourself).

### My lens

1. **Evidence‑first** — primary documents, reputable data, transparent sourcing.  
2. **Systems thinking** — seeing how money, messaging, and policing interlock.  
3. **Democratic values** — if a tactic erodes due process or free expression, it matters.
